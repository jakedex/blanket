## blanket (in progress/hackathon project)

Blanket is/was a [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) experiment around the idea that common HTML elements could be translated to a corresponding component in VR. The goal was to create a library of VR compenents, and a parser that would read in HTML classes and recreate the web page in VR. Well, we finished the library. And created an example of what we thought LinkedIn's site would look like in VR. Oh and btw, this was hacked together in < 24hrs at LinkedIn's [Intern Hackday](https://2016internhackday.splashthat.com/).
